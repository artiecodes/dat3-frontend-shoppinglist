# React-based Shopping List

## Description

This is a small application based on React to run a shopping list on the computer. It utilizes full CRUD operations on a local JSON server to manage data.

## Improvements

- The program could have been visually prettier (I'm sure the code wouldn't have said no to a cleanup either).
- Functionality for cloud-based data storage could have been implemented.
- Extensive error handling

## Features
- View your shopping list
- Create new items for the shopping list
- Delete existing items from the list
- Edit current items in the list

## Dependencies

- Node JS
- Json server

## Try it yourself
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artiecodes/dat3-frontend-shoppinglist.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dat3-frontend-shoppinglist
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the JSON server for data persistence:

    ```bash
    npm run jsonserver
    ```

5. Start the React application:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Visit `http://localhost:5173` to use the app, and `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api` to view the JSON data.
